## Installation

## Usage

Type into the boxes that are colored. Green means future; red means present; white means past. The colors change based on the current hour of the day. The input will be saved into the local storage. When you refresh, the input that was entered will display.

## Credits

I would like to thank my classmates during our group sessions. I would also like to thank the videos on YouTube for JQuery and forum posts regarding method uses. JQuery documentation is a lot. Also, a lot of Googling to figure out how the methods and built-in functions work.
